    <p>Dear new co-creator on the Map,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You are warmly welcomed to send and receive invitations, to connect with co-creators and manifest your important, shared life purpose!</p>
    <p>Also, please invite your best friends and members of other compassionate organizations to become visible on the Map.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We do, however, ask you to be heart-felt selective, and only invite people with:</p>
    <li> A unified world view, who don’t feel superior to others because "we are right" and "they are wrong". People with a unified world view will support the group's exploration of compassionate and inclusive solutions.</li>
    <li> An open mind, without a mission to primarily convert others to "their" solution. Open minded, humble people will allow for synergies and the highest creative potential of the group.</li>
    <li> A deep yearning for action, and not to only talk. Action oriented people will catalyze the effectiveness of the co-creative team.</li>
    <p></p>
    <p>Thus, please invite all the potential co-creators that you know to join us in transforming our world – people with the personal maturity to co-create, as described in the self-assessment.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Best regards from</p>
    <p>The Support Team for the "Map of Co-creators"</p>
